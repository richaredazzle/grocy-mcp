## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Workflow contracts**: stable preview/apply JSON schemas for chat- and vision-driven Grocy workflows
- **Workflow tools**: product-match preview, stock-intake preview/apply, and shopping-reconcile preview/apply in both MCP and CLI surfaces
- **Workflow design docs**: new current design doc describing the two-layer architecture and no-raw-image boundary
- **Locations**: list and create storage locations (with freezer flag)
- **Stock journal**: view recent stock transaction history, optionally filtered by product
- **Tasks**: list, create, complete, and delete tasks (separate from chores)
- **Meal plan**: list, add, and remove meal plan entries; `meal-plan shopping` workflow
  to add missing ingredients for all planned recipes to the shopping list
- **Recipe editing**: update recipe name/description, add/remove ingredients by product name
- **Recipe create by name**: create recipes with ingredients specified by product name
  instead of numeric IDs
- **Recipe consume preview**: dry-run showing what stock would be deducted with OK/SHORT status
- **Shopping list ergonomics**: `set-amount` and `set-note` commands for quick edits
  without raw JSON
- **`--json` flag**: global CLI option for machine-readable JSON output on all list/view commands
- **`--url` / `--api-key` flags**: top-level CLI config overrides
- **Short option flags**: `-l`, `-a`, `-n`, `-d`, `-i`, `-r` across relevant commands
- **JSON validation**: clear error messages for malformed JSON arguments (exit code 2)
- **Entity tool split**: `entity_manage_tool` split into `entity_create_tool`,
  `entity_update_tool`, `entity_delete_tool` for safer agent use
- **GitHub Actions CI**: lint, test (Python 3.11/3.12/3.13), and build verification
- **Integration test support**: opt-in tests gated on `GROCY_URL` + `GROCY_API_KEY`
